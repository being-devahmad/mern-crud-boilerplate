# MERN Stack Task Manager

This is a boilerplate MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and state management using the Context API. The application is a simple task manager where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks.

## Features

- Full MERN stack implementation
- RESTful API with Express.js
- MongoDB database integration
- React frontend with functional components and hooks
- Global state management using Context API
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- `backend`: Contains the Node.js/Express.js server and API
- `frontend`: Contains the React application

### Backend Structure

```
backend/
├── config/
│   └── db.js
├── controllers/
│   └── taskController.js
├── middleware/
│   └── errorMiddleware.js
├── models/
│   └── taskModel.js
├── routes/
│   └── taskRoutes.js
├── .env
├── package.json
└── server.js
```

### Frontend Structure

```
frontend/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── context/
│   │   └── TaskContext.js
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js

```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB (v4 or later)

## Installation

To install the Task Manager, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-task-manager.git
   cd mern-task-manager
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-manager
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```
   Adjust the `MONGODB_URI` if you're using a different MongoDB connection string.

## Usage

To run the Task Manager, follow these steps:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The React app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. You can now use the Task Manager to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- GET `/api/tasks`: Fetch all tasks
- POST `/api/tasks`: Create a new task
- PUT `/api/tasks/:id`: Update a task by ID
- DELETE `/api/tasks/:id`: Delete a task by ID
